# Package permissions

## Overview
The permissions package provides a robust and flexible permission management system for controlling access to various features and functionalities within applications. It implements a granular permission model that can be used to enforce access control at different levels of the application.

## Key Components

### Permission Types
The package defines two main sets of permissions:

1. Core Permissions:
   - User Management (add, view, edit, delete users)
   - Role Management (add, view, edit, delete roles)
   - Catalog Management (settings, sync, export)
   - Hub Management (locations, inventory, dispatching)
   - Order Management (online, offline, shipping)
   - Customer Management
   - System Configuration

2. Extended Permissions:
   - Order Operations (view, create, approve, shipment, cancel)
   - Return Order Management
   - Split Order Operations
   - Customer Operations
   - Sales Person Management
   - Shipment Management
   - Configuration Management
   - Hub and Location Management
   - Product and SKU Management

## Features

### Basic Permission Management
- Individual permission checks for specific actions
- Multiple permission validation for complex operations
- Role-based access control support
- Hierarchical permission structure

### Access Control
- Fine-grained control over user actions
- Support for different permission levels
- Flexible permission grouping
- Easy integration with authentication systems

### System Integration
- Compatible with middleware-based architectures
- Support for microservices
- Extensible permission definitions
- Scalable permission management

## Best Practices

1. Always check permissions before performing sensitive operations
2. Use granular permissions instead of broad access controls
3. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using permission combinations
4. Cache permission checks when appropriate to improve performance
5. Log permission denials for security auditing

## Common Use Cases

1. User Management
   - Control access to user data
   - Manage user roles and permissions
   - Handle user authentication and authorization

2. Order Processing
   - Validate order creation permissions
   - Control order modification access
   - Manage shipping and fulfillment permissions

3. Inventory Management
   - Control stock modification access
   - Manage location access permissions
   - Handle inventory transfer authorizations

4. System Configuration
   - Restrict sensitive settings access
   - Control system-wide configurations
   - Manage integration settings

## Notes

- The package supports both simple and complex permission scenarios
- Permissions are defined as string constants for type safety
- The system is extensible - new permissions can be added easily
- Suitable for both monolithic and microservice architectures
- Integrates well with standard middleware patterns

For more details about specific permissions and their usage, refer to the source code documentation in `permission.go` and `permissions_v2.go`.
