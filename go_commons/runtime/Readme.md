# Package runtime

## Overview
The runtime package manages application configurations and diagnostics related to the execution environment. It provides tools to initialize runtime parameters and monitor system performance.

## Key Components
- Runtime Configuration: Functions to set and retrieve runtime settings.
- Diagnostics Tools: Utilities to log and check system states.
- Context Management: Facilitate propagation of runtime context.

## Usage Example
~~~go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/omniful/go_commons/runtime"
)

func main() {
	rt := runtime.New() // pseudo-code: instantiate runtime object
	fmt.Println("Runtime initialized:", rt)
}
~~~

## Notes
- Critical for dynamic configuration in production systems.
