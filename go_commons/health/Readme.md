# Package health

## Overview
The health package implements endpoints and utilities for checking the application's status. It is essential for monitoring service uptime and performance.

## Key Components
- Health Check Endpoints: Serve HTTP endpoints reporting system health.
- Diagnostic Tools: Functions to assess resource usage and detect issues.
- Integration Support: Works with load balancers and orchestration tools.

## Usage Example
~~~go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"github.com/omniful/go_commons/health"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/health", health.Handler)
	fmt.Println("Health endpoint available on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
~~~

## Notes
